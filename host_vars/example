# There should be one file per host, named with the inventory hostname. The
# variables defined in that file will be used for that host. For example, to
# configure the docker TLS certificates, you would want to have defined:

docker_ca_cert: ''
docker_tls_cert: ''
docker_tls_key: ''

# For the proxy server, you do not need to define anything.
